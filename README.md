# CustomViewLab


A workshop for creating a custom view on Android.

The main file is MyCustomView.java. Inside of it, you will find the code that you are able to customize.
The design looks like the Apple Watch exercise app.
The values for creating the graphs are hardcoded, it's only for demonstration. That isn't a good practice. I will have reviewed the archictecure by next month.
